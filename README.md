# Data Visualization Final Project

### Introduction
Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. Scatter Plot designed to emphasize clustering of crimes in Boston. In this map of Boston, every crime report is pinned on map according to latitude and longitude. Different color representing the degrees of a crime ([UCR](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr)). Each circle represents a certain crime. Also time brushes can be used to select different time span to show crimes in a specific time period.

## Data

The data for my project is Boston crime incident reports (2019/08/01 ~ now). [Link to data](https://gist.github.com/GeniXiong/543400f47d4b937a6379a9105e70c47f). This is the Boston Crime dataset published at Analyze Boston.
 
 ## Features

 * A time brush can be applied to visualize crimes in a time period.
 
## Future Work
 * It will have a stack layout values of ucr for data, not a whole block.
 * It will highlight the crimes in a certain region when mouse hovers in this region.
