# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is 2015 Seattle House Price data

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. Scatter Plot designed to emphasize clustering of prices, year built, floors of the house, and living areas. Each circle represents a certain house. The size of the circle represents living areas of the house. Different colors represents floor numbers.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What is the distribution for average house prices accroding to it's location(zipcode)?
 * How is house prices relate to the number of bedrooms and bathrooms?
 * Are houses that were newly built tend to have smaller basement? (The area of basement according to built-year)
 * How are the floors change over built time?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

 * If I want to show the price distribution for floors distribution of the house, drawing a map of Seattle might be helpful and clear to understand. I don't know if there can be a way to draw a map of Seattle and with lines separating different zipcode. 
 * Beacause prices are too distributed, I want to split price into ordered catogories, that means 0 ~ $200K, 200K ~ 500K, 500K ~ 1000K, >1000K.
