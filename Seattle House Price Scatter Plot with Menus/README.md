This visualization shows a scatter plot of [The 2015 Seattle House Price data](https://gist.github.com/GeniXiong/e7c6bf03262966c543faa26805bf8bc7). It's a Scatter Plot designed to emphasize clustering of prices, year built, floors of the house, and living areas.


The project proposal can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/GeniXiong/Data-Visualization-Project-Proposal).

Each circle represents a certain house. The size of the circle represents living areas of the house. Different colors represents floor numbers.
